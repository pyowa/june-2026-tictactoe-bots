## Primitive obsession / magic literals

- ~~**Match result strings** — `"x_wins"`, `"o_wins"`, `"x_forfeit"`, `"o_forfeit"`, `"cat"` scattered across `entities/match/repository.py`, `dispatcher/match_runner.py`, `runner/engine.py`, and the test suite. An `Enum` or constants module would make mutations and misspellings compile-time errors. `check_winner()` (`runner/engine.py:43`) and `validate_move()` (`runner/engine.py:56`) both return/consume these strings directly.~~
- ~~**`dispatcher/pods.py:95`** — pod phase checked against magic strings `"Failed"`, `"Unknown"`.~~
- ~~**`dispatcher/match_runner.py:50–53`** — turns represented as `(("x", "X", ip_x), ...)`: positional tuples with no names. A small `@dataclass Turn` would clarify.~~
- ~~**`web/utils.py:43`** — `stripped[5:].strip()` / `stripped[7:].strip()` hard-codes character offsets for `"name:"` / `"python:"`. A named constant or `removeprefix()` would make this self-documenting and mutation-resistant.~~
- ~~**`entities/bot/repository.py:137–138`** — `lb_id`, `lb_base` — abbreviations that obscure meaning inside an already complex query.~~

---

## Duplication

- ~~**Stats subquery pattern** — `clean_wins`, `forfeit_wins`, `draws`, `losses` are each built as a correlated scalar subquery. The same pattern appears once in `leaderboard()` (lines 141–176) and again in `family()` (lines 268–303) — 8 nearly-identical COUNT subqueries total. A helper that builds the subquery given the filter arguments could collapse this significantly.~~
- ~~**Message JSON validation** — `dispatcher/pod_builder.py:61` and `dispatcher/ondeck_handler.py:30` both do identical `try: model_validate_json() / except: nack` blocks.~~
- ~~**Pod name construction** — `f"bot-{msg.bot_id}"` appears in both `pod_builder.py` and `match_runner.py`.~~

## Functions doing too many things

- ~~**`handle_submission()` (`web/submit.py:140`)** — reads file, validates source, parses cookie, resolves owner token, persists bot, enqueues match jobs, logs, renders template. At least three distinct concerns (validate → persist → respond).~~
- **`handle_build_pod_message()` (`dispatcher/pod_builder.py:54`)** — deserializes JSON, validates runtime, queries DB, creates pod, waits for readiness, updates DB, publishes reply. Seven concerns.
- ~~**`handle_match_ondeck()` (`dispatcher/ondeck_handler.py:23`)** — deserializes JSON, validates bots, checks pod existence, runs match, persists result.~~
- **`run_match_from_pods()` (`dispatcher/match_runner.py:34`)** — looks up IPs, drives game loop, classifies errors, records moves.
- ~~**`leaderboard()` (`entities/bot/repository.py:104`)** — latest-version filtering, per-version stats, lifetime rollup, intra-family exclusion. These are logically distinct queries stitched into one method.~~
- ~~**`handle_pod_ready_message()` (`match_scheduler/main.py:28`)** — deserializes JSON, validates message, queries DB, triggers match scheduling. Mixes I/O and orchestration.~~
- **`serve_rpc()` (`messaging/rpc_server.py:14`)** — sets up queue consumption, processes messages, and publishes replies. The handler coupling makes it hard to test the transport and logic separately.
- ~~**`main()` (`scripts/seed_example_bots.py:35`)** — clears DB, reads files from disk, parses bots, and inserts them. Multiple distinct phases in one function.~~

## Long parameter lists

| File | Function | Params | Suggestion |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| `dispatcher/pod_builder.py:38` | `_build_pod_and_wait()` | 6 | Group into a `BotPodSpec` dataclass |
| ~~`web/submit.py:115`~~ | ~~`_success_response()`~~ | ~~6~~ | ~~`owned` + `owner_token` could be a single `OwnerContext`~~ |
| `dispatcher/match_runner.py:34` | `run_match_from_pods()` | 5 | Group bot-side data into a `BotPodInfo` pair |

---

## Deep / untyped data structures

- ~~**`entities/match/repository.py:19–44`** — `_match_select()` returns a 3-tuple `(stmt, bx, bo)` with positional meaning. A named dataclass or `TypedDict` would clarify.~~
- ~~**`dispatcher/pods.py:117–129`** — `request_turn()` returns `dict[str, Any]` where callers must know to check for `"error"` vs `"board"` keys. A small `TurnResult` dataclass with a discriminated union would help.~~
- ~~**`dispatcher/match_runner.py:50–53`** — `turns` is a tuple of 3-tuples with positional semantics (symbol string, board character, IP). No names.~~ (resolved in Group 1 via `_Turn` dataclass)
- ~~**`web/utils.py:118–136`** — `group_matches_by_version()` returns `dict[str, list[Any]]`; the `Any` hides the row structure.~~

---

## Other notable smells

- ~~**Implicit state machine in `run_match_from_pods()`** (`dispatcher/match_runner.py:56–112`) — a `while True` loop with player-alternation and early returns. The flow would be clearer as an explicit loop over a fixed sequence of turns.~~
- ~~**Exception for control flow** (`web/submit.py:38–44`) — `_SubmissionError` is raised for expected validation failures, not exceptional conditions. A `Result`-style return or early return with a response would be more idiomatic.~~
- **`session.commit()` inside `BotRepository.create()`** (`entities/bot/repository.py:88`) — the repository committing removes the caller's ability to batch or roll back. Flush + let the caller commit is the pattern used elsewhere. (Skipped: `get_session()` does not auto-commit on exit, so changing to flush without caller-side commits would break persistence.)
- **`run_in_executor` wrapping a sync game loop** (`dispatcher/ondeck_handler.py:58–67`) — suggests the game loop could be made async rather than bridged.
- **Multiple `Bot` aliases in one query** (`entities/bot/repository.py`) — `bx`, `bo`, `bw`, `bw_inner` are all aliased from `Bot` within `leaderboard()`. Combined with the CTE complexity, this is the single hardest function to read in the codebase.
- **Silent error printing in `reset_db.py`** (`scripts/reset_db.py:96–110`) — kubectl failures print instead of raising, creating inconsistent error semantics with the rest of the script.
- ~~**Dead/skipped acceptance test** (`tests/acceptance/test_turn_rpc.py:12`) — entire test file skipped with "Old RPC architecture removed; new pipeline acceptance tests TBD". Either replace or delete.~~
- ~~**Test file organisation** (`tests/test_reset_db.py:69`) — `purge_rabbitmq_queues` tests mixed into a general reset_db file; the comment asks whether they deserve their own file.~~
- ~~**Nested `with (` grouping in test helpers** (`tests/test_ondeck_handler.py:96,202`) — multiple `patch` calls stacked in a single `with` block; extracting fixtures or using `pytest.mock.patch` as a decorator would reduce the visual nesting.~~
